The situation is as follows: one cluster, in need of an upgrade

Assets: We have extensive documentation, room to do backups
Trouble: deeply customized environment


Sophie has two head nodes (one is being used as a compute node, for some reason)


3 chassis, 36 nodes. https://noc.chibi.ubc.ca/wiki/Sophie/Sophie/

Plan:

Step 0:) (this is done)

The upgrade will blow away the root partition, but we have /etc/ and /opt backed up
 rsync -ai /opt jenkins@craniata:/sophie/opt

rsync -ai /etc jenkins@craniata:/sophie/etc

rsync -ai /usr/local/etc jenkins@craniata:/sophie/


 [root@sophie 14:10:39 build]# mount
/dev/sda1 on / type ext3 (rw)
proc on /proc type proc (rw)
sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,gid=5,mode=620)
/dev/sda5 on /state/partition1 type ext3 (rw)
/dev/sda2 on /var type ext3 (rw)
tmpfs on /dev/shm type tmpfs (rw)
tmpfs on /var/lib/ganglia/rrds type tmpfs (rw,size=12362112000,gid=99,uid=99)

So we'll lose /opt and /etc - so the  configs for automount, ldap integration, etc.


none on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw)
sunrpc on /var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs type rpc_pipefs (rw)
nfsd on /proc/fs/nfsd type nfsd (rw)
/dev/mapper/mpath1 on /state/partition1/home type ext3 (rw,grpquota,usrquota)
/dev/mapper/mpath6 on /state/partition1/scratch type ext3 (rw,grpquota,usrquota)
/dev/mapper/mpath5 on /state/partition1/slowscratch type ext3 (rw,grpquota,usrquota)
/state/partition1/apps on /share/apps type none (rw,bind)

/opt is only 5.3G

Step 0.5) Find somewhere to park all of the data in /localscratch - I can rsync this to craniata. Unfortunately, this is led me to discover yet more data that needs to be moved off of sophie before we can safely rebuild- all of /share , some 302G in all)



Step 1:) negotiate node shutdowns. (This will take a little while- important science being done! )

Prepare nodes for upgrade(i.e. boot from pxe)

# ssh-agent $SHELL
# ssh-add
# cluster-fork 'touch /boot/grub/pxe-install'
# cluster-fork '/boot/kickstart/cluster-kickstart --start'
# cluster-fork '/sbin/chkconfig --del rocks-grub'

Step 2. Upgrade headnode.

Step 3. Install /etc/nsswitch.conf
/etc/bacula
/etc/nscd.conf- possibly- might need adaptation for centos6
/etc/nrpe.d/
/etc/my.cnf - maybe
SSSD Configuration /etc/ssd/ssd.conf
/etc/openldap
/etc/pam.d/

/etc/quotoatab
/etc/quotagrpadmins

/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
/etc/gshadow
/etc/group
/etc/auto.home
/etc/auto.master

/etc/fstab
/etc/exports

Step 4:) Install applications

We can package all the applications with checkinstall http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
 (this way we get clean uninstalling/reinstalling).

My concern is that it writes to the rpm database if we make and install rpm packages.


 I had checked out https://nixos.org/nix/ to use for this, but it'd be a bit more work. Maybe better long term, better for multiple versions of things, but a bit of work to get oriented to the "builder" format.




List of requested applications:
1) wordom http://sourceforge.net/projects/wordom/files/latest/download (awkward binary)
2) CHARMM 39 - c39b1  (we keep c35b5 and c35b2 available as tarballs, in case someone needs to have it installed in future, to reproduce a result.)
3) Amber14 (backed up to craniata)
4) AmberTools14 (Also to Craniata)
5) Almost 2.1 http://www-almost.ch.cam.ac.uk/site/downloads/almost-2.1.0.tar.gz
6) openmpi, qsub (ships with rocks)
7) Dell specific management software.http://linux.dell.com/repo/hardware/ 
8) R (through yum)
9) python 2 (though yum)
10) matplotlib https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/matplotlib/matplotlib/matplotlib-1.4.3/matplotlib-1.4.3.tar.gz
11) scipy & numpy - get it through Anaconda? alternatively, through yum install numpy scipy python-matplotlib ipython python-pandas sympy python-nose

12) pandas https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/p/pandas/pandas-0.16.1.tar.gz#md5=fac4f25748f9610a3e00e765474bdea8
13) BLAST ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.2.30+-src.tar.gz
14) cmake hopefully available through yum
15) biopython - http://biopython.org/DIST/biopython-1.65.tar.gz
16) MDAnalysis https://pypi.python.org/packages/source/M/MDAnalysis/MDAnalysis-0.9.2.tar.gz
17) NAMD - 2.10 source tarball saved. Will place in locally accesible share.

18) ATLAS http://sourceforge.net/projects/math-atlas/files/Stable/3.10.2/atlas3.10.2.tar.bz2/download
19) gcc version 4.4 (including c++ and fortran extensions)
20:) Espritz http://protein.bio.unipd.it/download/ (binary)
21:) gcc, at least 4.6 for CHARMM

5:) Test that all the applications are working as expected.

6:) Get confirmation that all is working as expected.

6a:) build restore roll

7:) Install to nodes.

8:) Either: Never do this again, or do it once a quarter so that we get good at it.

8a:) Be able to do this three times a day.



Logistical support: some uninterrupted time required.
